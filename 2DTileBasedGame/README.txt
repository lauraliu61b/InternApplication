使用IDE（如Intellij）导入项目，进入2DTileBasedGame\byog\Core，运行Main.java开始游戏。

Build up 2D tile-based mazes using rectangular as fundamental shape. By using serialization of Java, we made saving and reloading the game possible. This is a group project in Berkeley CS61B. My contribution is designing the algorithm for the formation of the maze world and implementing the UI.

Language: Java.
Tool: Intellij.
